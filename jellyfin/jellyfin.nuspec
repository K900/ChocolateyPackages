### Live TV &amp; DVR

There is currently a beta for Android, Android TV and Fire TV apps. Other apps for other platforms are in development and are on their way.

### No centralized tracking. It's your data.
Jellyfin has no built-in tracking, and no central servers collecting your data. We believe in keeping our software open and transparent for everyone to see it, use it, and build on it.

### Free Software, and growing.
